<p align="center" >Holemap is a small library that can take groups of tile layers and group them in a buffer that can be used as a surface, this allows for quick and easy manipulations of tile layers through things like blending modes, shaders, and more!
Every buffer is also stored in memory and can be easily retrieved or deleted.
  <br>
  The project file contains 5 different examples on how Holemap can be used, from scaling to clipping.
